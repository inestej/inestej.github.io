I am a mathematician specializing in symbolic computation, holding a Ph.D. from Pierre and Marie Curie University (Sorbonne University, France). My academic career is distinguished by a passion for teaching and mentorship. I have taught at institutions in France and, since 2002, as a faculty member at the University of Carthage, where I teach calculus, optimization and operations research.

My research is conducted with the BIMS laboratory (LR16IPT09) at the Institut Pasteur de Tunis, focusing on polynomial dynamic systems in systems biology, bioinformatics and mathematical biology. I am particularly interested in applying computational methods using Python, R, and SAGEmath to model complex biomedical challenges in infectious diseases, such as rabies, leishmaniasis, and cancer.

With extensive experience in student supervision, I have guided over sixty students through their Graduation Project for the Engineering Degree (equivalent to a Master of Engineering thesis). My expertise has expanded to include neural networks, deep learning, and LLMsâ€”domains in which I publish and actively integrate into my work on extracting and leveraging medical data.
